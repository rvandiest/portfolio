                <p>I have a great passion for exotic wildlife, which comes in handy for my weekend job: selling exotic fish in a tropical fish store.</p>
                <p>Another thing that interests me is history. My specific interest in history shifts sometimes, but for the last few years it has been the first world war.</p>
                <p>I also like to tinker with hardware. I have some Arduinos that I like to play with. I recently bought a Raspberry Pi, but I haven't had the time to a lot with it yet.</p>
